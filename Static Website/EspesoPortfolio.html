My College life of this Covid-19 is quite bit challenging especially when it comes to Time. This pandemic gave me things that I should be thankful and reasons to hate as well.
 But not in terms  studies, I dont have any problems of connection due to fiber Internet. But the challenge is disciplining my self and being responsible as a student.Sometimes I think that face to face can be brought back like good Old days!!
Buts still thanks to God I have overcome the everyday happenings of my life.
